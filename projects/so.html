						Have you ever wanted to play god? To be able to create planet systems? Test new possibilities? See what would happen if solar system had two suns? Or if pluton rammed into the earth unimaginable speed? This project was made for that.
						It allows to set up your own solar system, or work on a ready one, as application uses NASA api to download data about our own solar system, letting you just observe or play with current planet.
						
						Project was made using C++ with cmake and googletest, integrates with python for easily configurable interfaces and uses curl to connect to api.</p>
